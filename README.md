# kubernetesfiles
Kubernetes files to tear up a working kubernetes environment on minikube

load-generator is optional to check that the auto-scale is working properly
deployment file is enough to deploy pods. No need for additional pods file if you are not planning to do specific configurations.
autoscale file is a generic file that I created to serve my purposes. Configure it as you wish.
